<h1>a website about credit cards</h1> 
<p>           Credit card companies are a business that provide people with the ability to borrow money and pay it back over time, usually with interest.</p>
<p>A credit card is a plastic card issued by a bank or other financial institution that allows consumers or businesses to borrow money from its issuer on credit terms, typically for spending at shops and other outlets.</p>
<p>The holder of the card can use it as proof of payment for goods and services rendered in exchange for immediate payment (a "credit"), which may be applied to any account held by the holder with the issuer.</p>
