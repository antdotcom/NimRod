<h2>What is a Credit Card?</h2>     
<p>A credit card is an instrument that allows consumers to borrow money from their bank or other lenders by using it as collateral in the form of a promise to pay back the borrowed amount with interest over time (a loan). This process involves applying for and being approved for a line of credit at a financial institution such as a bank, which then issues an individual account number and plastic card that can be used like cash anywhere Visa or MasterCard are accepted.</p></h2>
